## Description

**Anicole** is a service that allows users to watch anime online and play exciting games related to the main theme.
In the current version, users can browse new and popular anime or search for a specific title.
The games section currently includes only the Monkeytype game, which fully meets the requirements of the final project.
I'm planning to expand this app futher in the future adding new options like login, saving episodes, AI subtitles
translation and improving it's design.
App logo and header animation were made by me.
